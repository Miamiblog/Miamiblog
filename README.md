- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first bug in a computer program was literally an insect?
      In 1947, Grace Hopper and her team were working on the Harvard Mark II computer when they found a moth causing an issue.
      They taped the moth to their logbook with the note “First actual case of bug being found.”
      The term "debugging" for fixing computer errors became popular from that incident!
